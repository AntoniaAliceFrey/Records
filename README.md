* SQLite

## Conclusion
* The main steps for working with a SQLite database are connecting to a database, creating a cursor object, writing an SQL query, commiting changes, and closing the database connection.
* GUIs can be built with Tkinter windows and widgets. Tkinter arranges label, entry, and button widgets in a window using a grid layout. The button widgets can be linked to functions and the data in entry widgets can be extracted for use elsewhere.
